# set of optimizations that are enabled
# Most optimizations are only enabled if an -O level is set on the command 
# line. Otherwise they are disabled even if individual optimization flags 
# are specified.

# CPPFLAGS     ***LINUX, MACOSX: C/C++/Objective C preprocessor flags, 
# e.g. -I<include dir> if
# you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
# In build.sh: usually one does not need to specify anything 
# LINUX/MACOSX: Variable is ONLY exported if configured here
build_cppflags: "-I/MyInclude"

# CFLAGS    ***LINUX, MACOSX: C compiler flags
# In build.sh: usually one does not need to specify anything 
# LINUX: Variable is ONLY exported if configured here
# MACOSX: if not configured here the variable is exported with default:
# "-arch %(OSX_ARCH)s" where OSX_ARCH = i386 or x86_64
build_cflags: "-O2 -pipe"

# CXXFLAGS    ***LINUX, MACOSX: C++ compiler flags
# In build.sh: usually one does not need to specify anything 
# LINUX: Variable is ONLY exported if configured here
# MACOSX: if not configured here the variable is exported with default:
# same as: "CFLAGS"
build_cxxflags: "-O2 -pipe"

# LDFLAGS    ***LINUX, MACOSX: LD flags: linker flags, 
# e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a nonstandard directory <lib dir>
# In build.sh: usually one does not need to specify anything 
# LINUX: Variable is ONLY exported if configured here
# MACOSX: if not configured here the variable is exported with default:
# "-arch %(OSX_ARCH)s" where OSX_ARCH = i386 or x86_64
build_ldflags: "-L/home/MyLib" 

# FFLAGS     ***LINUX, MACOSX: Fortran 77 compiler flags 
# see http://linuxreviews.org/man/make.conf/
#   FFLAGS is usually passed to the FORTRAN 77 compiler, 
# and FCFLAGS to any FORTRAN compiler in more modern build systems.
# In build.sh: usually one does not need to specify anything 
# LINUX/MACOSX: Variable is ONLY exported if configured here
build_fflags: "-Wall"     
  
# FCFLAGS     ***LINUX, MACOSX: Fortran compiler flags 
# see http://linuxreviews.org/man/make.conf/
#   FFLAGS is usually passed to the FORTRAN 77 compiler, 
# and FCFLAGS to any FORTRAN compiler in more modern build systems.
# In build.sh: usually one does not need to specify anything 
# LINUX/MACOSX: Variable is ONLY exported if configured here
build_fcflags: "-Wall"      
          
# MAKEFLAGS    ***LINUX, MACOSX: MAKE FLAGS: e.g. multi-core option: always exported
# gnu make multi-core compile option: -j [N], --jobs[=N]  Allow N jobs at once; 
# jobs with no arg.
# In build.sh: usually one does not need to specify anything 
# LINUX/MACOSX: Variable is ONLY exported if configured here
# https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html
build_makeflags: "-j 1"

# CHOST    ***LINUX: CHOST: can be used for cross-compiling 
# e.g. passed on to: --host=$CHOST   or  maybe --target=$CHOST  
# http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/CHOST
# The variable is a dash-separated tuple in the form of ARCH-VENDOR-OS-LIBC. 
# ARCH specifies the CPU architecture, VENDOR specifies the hardware platform 
# or vendor, OS is the operating system, and LIBC is the C library to use. 
# Only ARCH is strictly required in all cases, but - for Linux machines at
# least - it's good practice to specify all four fields
# LINUX: Variable is ONLY exported if configured here
# USAGE example: in build.sh: ./configure --host=$CHOST
build_chost: "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"

# MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET    ***MACOSX: 
# MACOSX: if not configured here the variable is exported with default:
# "10.5"
build_macosx_deployment_target: "10.5"
