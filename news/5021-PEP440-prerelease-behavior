### Enhancements

* Support for handling of prerelease versions as recommended by PEP440 (#5021).
  New `prerelease_behavior` config and command line option may be set to allow
  prereleases (the default old behavior), exclude prereleases, or limit prereleases
  when already in the environment or when there is no other match.
