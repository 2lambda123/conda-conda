### Bug fixes

* Resolves [CVE-2023-30861](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30861). 
Previously, Conda had a requirements.txt file which contained flask==1.1.1. 
Rather than continuously updating flask to a later version as new vulnerabilities is discovered, 
we opt to use a conda-maintained package that we know does not contain security vulnerabilities.
