### Enhancements

* On Windows platforms using MSYS2, `conda activate` will now look for
  one of the [MSYS2 64-bit
  environments](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/), `UCRT64`,
  `CLANG64`, CLANGARM64` or `MINGW64`, as a preferential location for
  Windows native compilers and libraries.  `mingw-w64` will continue
  to be added to the user's `PATH` as a fallback location.

  This allows for multiple MSYS2 environments to be accommodated: for
  example either the GCC suite using either UCRTBASE or MSVCRT or the
  LLVM suite using UCRTBASE.

  New MSYS2 packages can now use the upstream installation prefixes,
  `{prefix}/ucrt64`, `{prefix}/clang64`, etc. and will be found and
  used in preference automatically.
