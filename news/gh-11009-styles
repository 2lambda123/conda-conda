### Enhancements

* Add and automatically run pre-commit as part of the CI system
  to improve the code quality continuously and raise issues
  in contributed patches early on.

  The used code linters are: [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/),
  [pylint](https://pylint.org/) and [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/).

  The [Python code formatter black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) is used
  as well but is only enforced on changed code in a commit and not to the
  whole code base at once.
