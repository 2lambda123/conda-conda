class TrackedMap(MutableMapping):
    """
    Implements a dictionary-like interface with self-logging capabilities.

    Each item in the dictionary can be annotated with a ``reason`` of type ``str``.
    Since a keyword argument is needed, this is only doable via the ``.set()`` method
    (or any of the derivative methods that call it, like ``.update()``). With normal
    ``dict`` assignment (Ã  la ``d[key] = value``), ``reason`` will be None.

    Reasons are kept in a dictionary of lists, so a history of reasons is kept for each
    key present in the dictionary. Reasons for a given ``key`` can be checked with
    ``.reasons_for(key)``.

    Regardless the value of ``reason``, assignments, updates and deletions will be logged
    for easy debugging. It is in principle possible to track where each key came from
    by reading the logs, since the stack level is matched to the originating operation.

    ``.set()`` and ``.update()`` also support an ``overwrite`` boolean option, set to
    True by default. If False, an existing key will _not_ be overwritten with the
    new value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        A short identifier for this tracked map. Useful for logging.
    data
        Initial data for this object. It can be a dictionary, an iterable of key-value
        pairs, or another ``TrackedMap`` instance. If given a ``TrackedMap`` instance,
        its data and reasons will be copied over, instead of wrapped, to avoid recursion.
    reason
        Optionally, a reason on why this object was initialized with such data. Ignored
        if no data is provided.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> TrackedMap("example", data={"key": "value"}, reason="Initialization)
    >>> tm = TrackedMap("example")
    >>> tm.set("key", "value", reason="First value")
    >>> tm.update({"another_key": "another_value"}, reason="Second value")
    >>> tm["third_key"] = "third value"

class SolverOutputState(Mapping):
    """
    This is the main mutable object we will massage before passing the
    result of the computation to the solver. It will also store the result
    of the solve.

    Its main intent is to populate the different spec pools with MatchSpec
    objects obtained from an ``SolverInputState`` instance.

    The main result of this operation is available through ``.pool_items()``,
    which returns ``str, MatchSpec`` tuples, mimicking ``dict.items()``. The
    key here is the pool name, which stands for a reason why this spec
    made it to the final list.

    The pool merging logic is done in ``._populate_pools()``.

    All of these pools will map package names (``str``) to ``MatchSpec`` (_specs_ in short)
    objects. A quick note on these objects:

    * They are a query language for packages, based on the ``PackageRecord`` schema.
      ``PackageRecord`` objects is how packages that are already installed are represented. This
      is what you get from ``PrefixData.iter_records()``. Since they are related,
      ``MatchSpec`` objects can be created from a ``PackageRecord``.
    * ``MatchSpec`` objects also feature fields like ``target`` and ``optional``. These are,
      essentially, used by the low-level classic solver (:class:`conda.resolve.Resolve`) to mark
      specs as items they can optionally play with to satisfy the solver constrains. A ``target``
      marked spec is _soft-pinned_ in the sense that the solver will try to satisfy that but it
      will stop trying if it gets in the way, so you might end up a different version or build.
      ``optional`` seems to be in the same lines, but maybe the entire spec can be dropped from the
      request? The key idea here is that these two fields might not be directly usable by the solver,
      but it might need some custom adaptation. For example, for ``libmamba`` we might need a separate
      pool that can be configured as a flexible task. See more details in the first comment of
      ``conda.core.solve.classic.Solver._add_specs``
