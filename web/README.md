You will need to

    pip install sphinxjp.themes.basicstrap
    pip install cloud_sptheme.ext.table_styling

Unfortunately, there are not a working conda packages for these yet, because
of https://github.com/pydata/conda/issues/488.

Use

    make html

to build the docs

Use

    make test

after you have built the docs to upload it to the test site, and

    make live

to upload it to the conda.pydata.org site. You will need ssh access to
pydata.org to do these (obviously).
