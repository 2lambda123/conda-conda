===========

The featured tutorials will show you how to create packages.
Before doing so, you must build a development environment for packaging.
You can review environment concepts in the `conda user guide <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts.html>`_.

Before you start the tutorials, you should already have
installed :doc:`Miniconda <../install/index>` or `Anaconda <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>`_. You also need to `install conda build <https://conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/source/install-conda-build.html>`_. 

As long as it is a pure Python package, you should only need Miniconda or Anaconda, conda build, Git, and bzip2. 
Some of these may already be present on Linux and MacOS machines. For building a pure Python package on Windows, 
you do not need Visual Studio unless you are starting to use compilers.
